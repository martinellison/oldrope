"Not that that is anything unusual, but this one seems to have died by some kind of magic, so I want you to investigate it". $[span alley]$"Thieves' Alley is one of the most disreputable parts of the City", he explains. "It's not just thieves that live there, it's every kind of criminal."$[end]$

$<p>$"Here is some $[link report]$more information$[end]$ from the guard post", he adds. $[span report]$"Officer Grommitt discovered the body of a man about 30 years old during his patrol of Thieves' Alley early this morning. There were no apparent injuries, but quick magic testing showed a very high degree of magic had been used against him. Grommitt's commander, Officer Sqiggs, recommends that the Special Squad be called in."$[end]$

$<p>$Officer Grommitt paces nervously back and forth in the small watch room. "It was really strange", he says. "There didn't seem to be any marks on the body at all. But when I ran a magic check on him, it came up bright orange. Somehow someone used a lot of magic on this guy, whoever he was."
