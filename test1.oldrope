$<p>$"Here is some $[link report]$more information$[end]$ from the guard post", he adds. $[span report]$"Officer Grommitt discovered the body of a man about 30 years old during his patrol of Thieves' Alley early this morning. There were no apparent injuries, but quick magic testing showed a very high degree of magic had been used against him. Grommitt's commander, Officer Sqiggs, recommends that the Special Squad be called in."$[end]$
