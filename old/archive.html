(click: ?alley)[&quot;Thieves&#39; Alley is one of the most disreputable parts of the City&quot;, he explains. &quot;It&#39;s not just thieves that live there, it&#39;s every kind of criminal.&quot;]

&quot;Here is some [more information]&lt;report| from the guard post&quot;, he adds. (click: ?report)[&quot;Officer Grommitt discovered the body of a man about 30 years old during his patrol of Theives&#39; Alley early this morning. There were no apparent injuries, but quick magic testing showed a very high degree of magic had been used against him. Grommitt&#39;s commander, Officer Sqiggs, recommends that the Special Squad be called in.&quot;]
